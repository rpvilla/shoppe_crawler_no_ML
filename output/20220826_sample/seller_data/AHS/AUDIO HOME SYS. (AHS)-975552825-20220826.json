When a subwoofer is used, it improves the volume of the entire low range of the speaker system, not only the front speakers, but also enhancing the bass from the subwoofer. You'll enjoy video and music with sound that has exceptional power and presence.\nWhen music is encoded into a digitally compressed format like MP3, the frequency response suffers. Yamahas Compressed Music Enhancer employs sophisticated digital signal processing using exclusive algorithms to restore what was lost, so the music always sounds the way it should.\nThe Subwoofer Trim control enhances the low frequencies by avoiding overlap with the front speaker output. This will result in a cleaner, more focused sound stage while providing a seamless frequency response. When subwoofer frequency overlap occurs in conventional systems, the overall sound is pushed toward the subwoofer. Subwoofer Trim takes care of this by separating the low subwoofer frequencies cleanly, thus stabilising the front stage while providing a well-balanced enhanced bass sound.\nYamahas new ECO mode reduces power consumption by about 20%. It can be set from the top of the GUI menu.\nAuto Power Standby lets you save energy by selecting to turn off the power after 20 minutes, 2, 4, 8 or 12 hours.", "orig_price": 0.0, "stock": 2, "historical_sold": 6, "sold": 0, "model_count": 1, "model_stock": 2, "model_name": "", "model_orig_price": 0.0, "model_sale_price": 3800000.0, "final_price": 3800000.0, "model_sold": 0, "total_model_sold": 0, "voucher_discount": "", "model_contribution": 1.0, "sales_units": 0, "warranty": "", "show_original_guarantee": false}]
