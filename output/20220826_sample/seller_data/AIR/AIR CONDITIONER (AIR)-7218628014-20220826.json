Fast Cooling mode operates with the fastest fan speed, before slowing down. So it cools or heats much faster compared to the normal mode* and reaches the desired temperature in the shortest time. It?s ideal for immediate relief from the heat outside. \n\n\n\nBreathe purer air\n\nHD Filter\n\nMake sure that the air you breathe is always clean and fresh. The HD Filter is really effective at capturing dust, airborne contaminants and allergens, such as pollen, mold spores and pet dander. And it?s also washable, so all you need to do is give it a quick rinse in water and then reuse it. \n\n\n\nEnjoy a good sleep\n\nGood Sleep\n\nEnjoy a great night?s sleep ? every night! Good Sleep mode automatically controls and fine-tunes the temperature to create the ideal conditions for each stage of the sleep cycle. So you gain precious minutes of sleep and feel fully refreshed. And it also uses less energy than normal cooling. \n\n\n\nCools every corner\n\n2-Way Auto Swing\n\nCreate a comfortable environment with an even temperature in every corner. The 2-Way Auto Swing function automatically controls the air flow direction, so it?s quickly and evenly distributed across the room. It can expel cool or warm air further and in every direction to ensure maximum comfort. \n\n\n\nLong-lasting cooling\n\nDuraFin+\n\nStay comfortably cool for much longer. The DuraFin+ is made of corrosion-resistant material to protect the condenser from rusting, which helps to maintain the optimal performance of the Heat Exchanger. Its superb corrosion-resistance was proven using the Salt Spray Test (SST) for 480 hours*. \n\n\n\nLow Ambient (Cooling, ?): 18~43 ?\n\n\n\nPower Consumption(Cooling, W): 350 W\n\n\n\nGaransi 1 tahun", "orig_price": 3599000.0, "stock": 26, "historical_sold": 1438, "sold": 36, "model_count": 1, "model_stock": 26, "model_name": "", "model_orig_price": 3599000.0, "model_sale_price": 2849000.0, "final_price": 2849000.0, "model_sold": 0, "total_model_sold": 0, "voucher_discount": "", "model_contribution": 1.0, "sales_units": 36, "warranty": "", "show_original_guarantee": true}]
