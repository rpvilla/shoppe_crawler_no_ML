This sensor is benefited by the inclusion of a long-reaching 35x optical zoom lens, giving a 35mm-equivalent focal length range of 25-875mm. For shooting in low-light conditions and when working at greater zoom magnifications, Optical SteadyShot image stabilization is available to counter the effects of camera shake. \n\nFor monitoring and playback of images, as well as navigating the menu system, a 3.0\" 461k-dot Clear Photo LCD is available and offers five brightness steps to aid in viewing in bright conditions.
